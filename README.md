# La-Vue-WhatsApp-automation-Bot

# Overview:
I developed and optimized a WhatsApp chatbot for La Vue, a boutique group accommodation in La Roche-en-Ardenne, Belgium, using Make.com (formerly Integromat) and integrated with the GREEN API for WhatsApp. The bot serves as a 24/7 concierge, assisting prospective and current guests with inquiries about stays, facilities, prices, booking details, nearby activities, and practical information.
# Key Features:
Intelligent Responses: Leverages OpenAI (GPT-4o) to provide warm, solution-oriented answers based on a custom FAQ database, supporting English, Dutch, and French.
Workflow Automation: Designed a streamlined scenario with database integration (e.g., message history), variable management, and automated escalation to human support when needed.
Rule Enforcement: Implemented strict guidelines to prevent booking/availability confirmations, ensuring compliance with privacy and safety standards (e.g., no card details, emergency 112 advice).
Optimization: Reduced redundancy by merging multiple nodes (e.g., AI calls, data retrieval), improving efficiency and reducing operational costs in Make.com.
# Challenges Solved:
Addressed initial issues like inconsistent responses and no-replies by refining prompts and consolidating a two-AI-call system into a single, robust Chat Completion node.
Prevented unwanted booking offers by strengthening anti-booking rules and testing edge cases (e.g., "Can you book a room?").
Enhanced multi-language support and conversation memory for intelligent, context-aware replies.
# Skills Demonstrated:
Tools: Make.com, OpenAI API, GREEN API for WhatsApp, Database Management (e.g., Airtable, Google Sheets).
Programming: Prompt engineering, workflow automation, variable mapping.
Problem-Solving: Debugging AI behavior, optimizing workflows, ensuring compliance with client requirements.
# Outcome:
The bot now handles ~100% of guest inquiries effectively, with a clean, scalable design ready for further enhancements (e.g., voice mode, DeepSearch integration). This project showcases my ability to build practical, AI-driven solutions for hospitality and customer service automation.
